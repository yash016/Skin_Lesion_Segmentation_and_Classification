# Skin Lesion Segmentation and Classification

### This repository consists of Jupyter notebooks in which the task of segmenting the skin lesions as well as classifying them into 7 different categories is performed.

<br/>

## Datasets Used:    

### 1. Skin Lesion Segmentation: PH2 Database
**PH2 database** contains a total of 200 dermoscopic images of melanocytic lesions, including 80 common nevi, 80 atypical nevi, and 40 melanomas with dimensions 768x560 pixels.

### 2. Skin Lesion Classification: HAM10000 Dataset

**HAM10000** dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes. The dimension of images in this dataset is 600x450 pixels.

## Models:

### 1. Skin Lesion Segmentation:

#### 1. Fully Convolutional Network(FCN):
Fully Convolutional Networks, orÂ FCNs, are an architecture used mainly for semantic segmentation. They employ solely locally connected layers, such as **convolution**, **pooling** and **up sampling**. Avoiding the use of dense layers means less parameters (making the networks faster to train). It also means an FCN can work for variable image sizes given all connections are local

#### 2. UNet:
U-Net is an architecture for Biomedical image segmentation. It consists of a contracting path and an expansive path, which gives it the u-shaped architecture. The contracting path is a typical convolutional network that consists of repeated application of convolutions, each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a max pooling operation. During the contraction, the spatial information is reduced while feature information is increased. The expansive pathway combines the feature and spatial information through a sequence of up-convolutions and concatenations with high-resolution features from the contracting path.
